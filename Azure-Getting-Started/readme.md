# Getting Started with Azure
This area constitutes all the resources for getting started with Azure. It similarly includes the full list of Microsoft Documentation and links to the videos related to the subjects.
I recommend starting with the OpenEdx course below as it is free and provide a certificate if you pass the exam.

You can find relevant Powershell commands associated with databases here: [azure-getting-started-powershell](https://github.com/kristofferandreasen/awesome-azure/blob/master/azure-getting-started/azure-getting-started-powershell.ps1)
